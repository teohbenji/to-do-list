<h1>Remaining things to practice with </h1>

> 1. Finish up mock form validation (fields being highlighted red, global error message red box at the top)
> 2. Properly format the input fields, labels and buttons, so to look like the one that you created for iTrack (removing attachments)
> 3. Create a popup modal that will ask the user if he is sure of deleting the todo <strong>(Just for practice)</strong>
